# CSCD427 - Advanced Database Management

### Command Line B-Tree

This project implements a **Command Line B-Tree** that takes an input file, processes it, and arranges the words into a **B-Tree format**. It then displays the resulting B-Tree structure directly in the command line.

### Key Concepts:
- **B-Tree data structure**: A self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows efficient insertion, deletion, and searching.
- **File input processing**: Reading words from an input file and storing them in the tree.
- **Command Line Output**: Displaying the structure of the B-Tree in the terminal for visualization.

### Learning Outcomes:
- **Efficient data storage**: This project highlights the **efficiency advantages** of using B-Trees for organizing and accessing large datasets.
- **Comparative database storage methods**: By implementing a B-Tree, I learned how different database storage methods impact performance, particularly for large-scale data operations.
